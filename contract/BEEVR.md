# **BEEVR** Letter Of Engagement

Dear **Benedict John Percival Robb**,

This letter is to confirm our understanding of the terms of our engagement and the nature and limitations of the services that we provide.

................................

This agreement is between:

**Maja Kudlicka** and also **Antonio Trabalza**

And

**Benedict John Percival Robb**

On behalf of
           **BEEVR**.


### Purpose, Scope and Terms of the Engagement

##### Duration & Term
As agreed **BEEVR** is commissioning **4 (four)** weeks of work. A week consists of 5 working days.
If the project takes longer than expected the features in the scope will still be delivered for the agreed price.

**Benedict John Percival Robb** and **BEEVR** will retain ownership of the code created for the MVP during its preparation and following the conclusion of the period of engagement.


#### Scope
The scope of work will be as outlined in the minimum schedule of deliverables, which will be set by the developers at the start of the project following consultation with the client.

##### Ongoing Costs Summary
You’ll be responsible for paying any costs of the hosting services. We’ll agree these costs with you beforehand before we sign you up. These aren’t included in the price for the app build.

##### Rates
The fee arrangement is based on Founders & Coders’ MVP offering and is fixed for the initial MVP scope being commissioned. The cost of a sprint (two-weeks) is £750 (GBP) per person.

#### Billing
100% of the first sprint should be paid before work commences. Hereafter, payment will be due at the end of each sprint.

#### Bugs
A bug is an agreed deliverable that is not functioning as described in the minimum schedule of deliverables. It does not encompass changes to the specification or features not defined in the schedule. 

When a feature is ready, it is the responsibility of the Product Owner (client) to test it and report bugs, if any. This is a continuous process throughout the development cycle. 

#### Cross-browser compatibility  
The completed work cannot be guaranteed to function correctly on all platforms. Any browsers or devices on which the work will be required to function correctly must be explicitly included in the minimum schedule of deliverables.

#### Open Source
The software will be developed on a public repository hosted on GitHub, unless the client requests otherwise and provides a privately-hosted repository for that purpose.

#### Ongoing maintenance
After successful completion, the client may retain, for the purposes of support or development, one or more of the contractors, by mutual agreement and subject to availability, pending agreement with the developers concerned.

##### Confirmation of Terms

I confirm that I agree to terms outlined in this engagement letter.
